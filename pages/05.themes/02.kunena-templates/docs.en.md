Kunena needs a Kunena-specific template (not to be confused with Joomla! templates) in order to format its output.

The Kunena project provides three templates:

- Crypsis is based on Bootstrap 2, and as such can coexist with the Joomla! Beez3 and Protostar templates, and other Joomla! templates that are based on Bootstrap 2. It can also be used if you enable the "Load Bootstrap" option on the crypsis template settings; this will load the default Bootstrap 2 version that is shipped with Joomla! 3.x.
- Crypsisb3 is based on Bootstrap 3.
- Blue Eagle, which is a paid download, is an HTML-based template. This means it should be able to coexist with all Joomla! templates.  (There can be some small CSS issues, depending on the CSS of the Joomla! template.)

Other Kunena templates may be found on the internet, and in the Manual section of this documentation you can find information about how to install a Kunena template, or how to modify one.

By editing the Kunena template settings you can, to some extent, determine which kinds of information you wish to display.
