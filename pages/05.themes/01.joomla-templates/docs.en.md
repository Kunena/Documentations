The subject of *templates* is made complicated by the fact that both Joomla! and Kunena use templates, and they are not the same thing at all.

The Joomla! system provides two default templates, Beez3 and Protostar. In addition, there are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of other Joomla! templates available from various software companies and template collection websites on the internet.

An important consideration relative to the use of Kunena is whether or not the Joomla! template you are using is based on the Bootstrap system. Protostar (and Beez3, although optional?) is based on Bootstrap 2. If you are using a third-party template with Joomla! you need to know whether it is based on Bootstrap in order to make decisions about which Kunena template to use.
