You may occasionally want to change a text passage or a word, or you may encounter a language key displayed (such as COM_KUNENA_PUBLISH), indicating a missing translation. This can be easily changed by using the Joomla language override feature.

### Overwrite text

* Go to **_Backend -> Extensions -> Language(s) -> Overrides_**
